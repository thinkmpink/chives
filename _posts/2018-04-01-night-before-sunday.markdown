Because it's time I spoke up, I'm fabricating a platform. 

I miss what little writing I did in college and high school and even earlier (some of my earliest work parroted Hardy Boys novels although you'll never see it here). I've had writerly feelings for many years that won't go away. When I'm speaking, I worry about my sentences, so I might as well put them somewhere more permanent than the breath of an instant.

I want to have a corpus: art I've brought to life, and I want to justify my thoughts before others so they may be concrete and anchored in reality.

Large corporate social networks are not and will never be the right place for such an endeavor. I want to own my work, as much as anyone can, but I'd rather not be the product if it's all the same to you. Moreover, simple websites are beautiful, in much the same way books are. They are exactly what's written down, and with any luck are not trying to sell you anything.

Here's to the hope that sincerity musters.
